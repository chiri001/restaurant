        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Nestled on the shores of Boston, Ocean's Bounty was born from a 
                family's lifelong connection to the sea. Our founders, the 
                Smith family, have been fishermen and seafood enthusiasts 
                for generations. Their dream was to create a place where the 
                community could savor the finest seafood while feeling the 
                ocean breeze and hearing the soothing waves. Today, their 
                vision has become a reality, and we continue to share their 
                passion with each guest who walks through our doors.</p>
